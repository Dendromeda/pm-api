    "lyrics": "Gather my friends, I'll tell you my story\nOf mountains and kings, and quests for our lord\nTimes of despair, without honour or glory\nI fought with my steel, I believed in my sword\nIn a sphere of crystal we could see a sign of hope\nAnd our flame was lit anew and we fought with\nRegained strength\nRiding on the wings of might\nThunder and lightning strikes from the skies\nShining flames of magic fire\nFighting for kingdom of honour and steel\nLord of evil do pay heed\nYour dark realm of shadows has come to an end\nKnights of twilights might will rise\nRiding towards gates of glory\nHope in my heart, I set sail for a new world\nOf light and of peace, I had wandered so far\nFinally here, at the end of my journey\nI feel so revived, I feel so strong\nAncient tales of battles slowly leaving memories\nNow we're all at ease, in our land of make believe\nRiding on the wings of might\nThunder and lightning strikes from the skies\nShining flames of magic fire\nFighting for kingdom of honour and steel\nLord of evil do pay heed\nYour dark realm of shadows has come to an end\nKnights of twilights might will rise\nRiding towards gates of glory\n\"And as the magic was drained from the holy lands\nAncient wisdom was awoken, and heroes from long ago\nWhispered stories forgotten\"\nRiding on the wings of might\nThunder and lightning strikes from the skies\nShining flames of magic fire\nFighting for kingdom of honour and steel\nLord of evil do pay heed\nYour dark realm of shadows has come to an end\nKnights of twilights might will rise\nRiding towards gates of glory"

    "lyrics": "Winter came without warning\nA cold misty breeze in the morning\nWhirling ice, stinging eyes\nA cold age of snow will arise\nAs the storm never ended\nWe feared it was somehow defended\nSo in the cloak of a blizzard\nShe appeared as foretold by the wizard\nIn the cover of darkness we will ride\nTo the eye of the storm\nWe must leave to ensure the balance\nOf seasons restored\nWe will fly (together)\nWe will ride (forever)\n'Til the spring will come again\nWe will fly (together)\nWe will ride (forever)\nThe sunlight is still far away\nFlames of mighty dragons\nLighting up the skies\nA new day dawns\nOf magic glory eternally\nThrough the cold misty mountains\nWith the guidance of our lanterns\nSwirling white of her spirit\nLoosing strength, oh, we can feel it\nWinter winds torn apart\nBy the fire in our hearts\nAll we had was our faith\nBut it's all that you need in the night\nIn the cover of darkness we will ride\nTo the eye of the storm\nWe must leave to ensure the balance\nOf seasons restored\nWe will fly (together)\nWe will ride (forever)\n'Til the spring will come again\nWe will fly (together)\nWe will ride (forever)\nThe sunlight is still far away\nFlames of mighty dragons\nLighting up the skies\nA new day dawns\nOf magic glory eternally\nNow, heed my final call\nRise your mighty swords to the sky\nAssault!\nWe will fly (together)\nWe will ride (forever)\n'Til the spring will come again\nWe will fly (together)\nWe will ride (forever)\nThe sunlight is still far away\nFlames of mighty dragons\nLighting up the skies\nA new day dawns\nOf magic glory eternally"
